# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Dimensionality Reduction & Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** for **dimensionality reduction and classification** using a real-world dataset. LDA is a supervised technique that maximizes class separability, making it useful for classification problems.

## 📊 Dataset
We use a real-world dataset (e.g., **Iris dataset** or **Wine dataset**) available in `scikit-learn`. The dataset consists of multiple features, and we apply LDA to maximize class separation while reducing dimensionality.

## 🔥 Implementation Steps
1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Explore & preprocess the data** (handle missing values, normalize features, etc.)
3. **Apply LDA** to find the best projection for classification
4. **Visualize class separability using LDA components**
5. **Train a classifier before & after LDA**
6. **Compare model performance and analyze the impact of LDA**

## 📈 Results & Insights
✅ LDA helps reduce the number of dimensions while preserving class separability.
✅ The LDA-transformed space enhances classification performance.
✅ Model accuracy before & after LDA is compared to validate improvements.
✅ LDA is useful for multi-class classification problems.
